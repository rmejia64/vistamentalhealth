						<h1 className="service-header">Medication Management</h1>
						<p className="service-description">
							Should you choose to see one of our psychiatrists, we can provide
							you with both medication management as well as therapy (if you
							choose). Most of our patients choose therapy along with medication
							management, but others choose one or the other. We can help you
							with coming up with an individualized treatment plan that
							incorporates the biopsychosocial model of treatment for the best
							possible outcome. Our psychiatrists are expert
							psychopharmacologists and can help with you maintaining or
							initiating treatment.

						<h1 className="service-header">Individial Therapy</h1>
						<p className="service-description">
							Individual Therapy is an opportunity for growth. It is a safe
							space that is created where one can begin to heal and grow as a
							person. Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a very effective
							form of treatment that we often use, it teaches individuals how to
							identify their cognitive distortions and make the necessary
							changes moving forward. Psychodynamic psychotherapy is another
							modality of treatment that is used, this type of therapy helps
							individuals understand how the past affects current behaviors so
							that these can be changed into more helpful ways of coping.

						<h1 className="service-header">Couple's Counseling</h1>
						<p className="service-description">
							Couples counseling helps improve communication and rebuild the
							bond that you once had with your partner. It is about enabling
							each partner to be heard and to hear themselves. It is about
							providing a mirror to reflect the change and provide a direction
							that will lead to growth. It is about identifying negative
							interaction cycles and being given the guidance to make the right
							changes. It is about rekindling a sense of intimacy. We can help
							you with your goals for your relationship.

							Biofeedback can effectively manage conditions such as chronic
							pain, anxiety, depression, migraines, and insomnia, empowering you
							to maintain balance even in stressful situations. It's a powerful
